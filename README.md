## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 
after 10 years as a 3D graphic designer specialized in interior architecture, 
I returned to school at 42 Lyon to become a programmer.

I am currently in an apprenticeship as a fullstack developer, 
and I'm also closely interested in AI and Web3. 

I am preparing for an RNCP7 title (BAC+5 / Postgraduate Degree -5 years of higher education) in Database and AI.
